# Repeatable and deployable Permission Sets for TYPO3

*** Please note that this extension is still in testing phase ***

This extension allows to attach a set of permissions to TYPO3 Backend UserGroups
based on files.

These sets of permissions are put in files and can be stored on a per-project
basis or in extensions.

Currently, the only supported configuration file for permission sets
is YAML.

This extension works with TYPO3 v11+.

## Installation

You can install this extension by using composer:

    composer req b13/permission-sets
